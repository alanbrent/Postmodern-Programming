# Postmodern Programming

This is a talk about declarative programming in and around imperative code: what, why, and how.

I wrote this talk for the presentation I was invited to give at [CocoaConf Columbus 2013](http://cocoaconf.com/columbus-2013/home). This is the first technical talk I gave, and although I rehearsed in an attempt to get the timing down and came in well undertime, I ended up hitting the 90min mark and still having a sixth to a quarter of my material left to coverâ€”not to mention the 20min Q&A I had intended to have!

Lessons learned.
